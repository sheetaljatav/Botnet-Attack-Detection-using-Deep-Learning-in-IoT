# Botnet-Attack-Detection-using-Deep-Learning-in-IoT

Abstract— Botnet assaults on Internet of Things (IoT) devices 
are extremely harmful, yet deep learning (DL) detection 
requires a lot of memory and traffic on the network, and is not 
effective on devices with minimal memory. Dimensionality 
reduction techniques can be used to reduce the number of 
attributes in IoT network traffic. Thousands of botnet assault 
events classified as DDoS, DoS, reconnaissance, and 
information stealing are included in the publicly accessible 
Bot-IoT dataset. The IoT network can utilize the dataset to 
detect botnet traffic. 
Two-dimension reduction methods that might be 
helpful in reducing the dataset’s total feature dimensions are 
PCA and autoencoding. An intermediary hidden layer is used 
by the autoencoder, an unsupervised deep learning method, to 
produce a latent-space representation of the data. Deep 
learning techniques, such as Long Short-Term Memory 
(LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), can detect 
botnet attacks using the decreased feature set. The approach's 
success can be assessed using performance metrics such as 
accuracy, precision, recall, and a confusion matrix. 


In conclusion, the suggested approach is to lower the 
dimensionality of the features of the Bot-IoT dataset using 
dimensionality 
reduction 
techniques 
autoencoder, enabling DL models like CNN and LSTM to 
detect botnet attacks. There are several performance measures 
available for assessing the technique.

I. INTRODUCTION 
There is a growing need for improved cybersecurity 
measures to prevent cyberattacks as the usage of IoT 
devices increases. Botnet attacks are very dangerous 
because they can target multiple devices at once. A new 
dataset that can identify important characteristics and 
identify Bot-IoT attacks occurring in IoT network domains 
has been released in an effort to combat this problem.  
This dataset encompasses statistics not only on regular IoT 
traffic but also on various cyberattack traffic flows, 
particularly botnet attacks. It was meticulously crafted 
using a realistic test bed, ensuring useful information 
properties were included. Additional characteristics were 
incorporated to refine machine learning algorithms and 
prediction models, categorized and subcategorized 
according to attack flows to enhance accuracy. 


 With the IoT device count projected to surpass 27 million  
in 2021, integrating IoT technology into daily life deepens. 
However, this expansion invites a corresponding increase 
in cyber threats, exploiting device vulnerabilities due to 
insufficient security resources. Botnet-based assaults, adept 
at evading conventional detection systems, are rampant in 
IoT setups. To counter this, a sequential detection 
framework based on machine learning is proposed. 
Employing effective feature selection strategies, 
researchers combined PCA, convolutional neural networks 
(CNN), and long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithms to 
develop a lightweight yet high-performance detection 
system. Botnets, controlled remotely by a single entity 
known as a "botmaster," can operate covertly, ranging from 
a few hundred to tens of thousands of compromised hosts. 
like 
PCA and 
To safeguard IoT devices from advanced botnet attacks, 
machine learning techniques, particularly CNN and LSTM, 
have been integrated into network intrusion detection 
systems. However, traditional NIDS techniques struggle 
with the high-dimensional network traffic data inherent in 
IoT systems. To address this, an end-to-end deep learning
based method is proposed, leveraging feature selection and 
dimensionality reduction to identify sophisticated botnet 
attacks accurately. 
II. LITERATURE SURVEY 
[7] In the paper, the ability of the IoT to deliver better 
services is causing it to gain popularity quickly. Many 
devices have this technology nicely incorporated into them. 
IoT hardware is now expanding swiftly. Security is 
beginning to become a significant worry as a result of this 
expansion. Attackers are employing and relishing tactics 
such as botnet-based Internet of Things (IoT) attacks more 
and more. Different contexts and limited resources, 
including minimal memory and computing power, are 
present in IoT. 
[8] The growing requirement for connectivity and the 
human need for the internet have contributed significantly 
to the rise in the quantity of internet-of-things devices. 
According to recent data, malware attacks on IoT devices 
increased dramatically from 10.3 million in 2017 to 32.7 
million in 2018, an astounding 215.7% increase.  
1 
This implies that the number of possible attack surfaces 
rises with the number of IoT devices, which raises the 
possibility of network attacks. This illustrates how 
Internet of Things networks and gadgets are becoming 
increasingly vulnerable.  
[10] Additionally, the descriptive features of the initial 
study were explained. The survey indicates that there has 
been activity in this subject of study during the last three 
years (2018–2020). The majority of the study is classified 
as system, model, and assessment, and the final eight 
notable items were noted. 
[11] The resource limitations of IoT devices and the 
unpredictability of IoT protocols may make typical 
security measures inadequate for protecting IoT networks 
and devices from cyber threats. Therefore, specific tools, 
approaches, and datasets created for its unique properties 
must be employed to improve IoT security. Here, we're 
offering a platform that makes it possible to develop IoT 
security solutions that can identify unusual activity in a 
variety of IoT applications while taking into account the 
unique characteristics of each one. 


III. METHODOLOGY 
The BoT-IoT dataset was utilized as the system's input 
after being approved in its original form from the dataset 
repository. During the data preprocessing phase, the data 
was scaled, standardized, and the values that were absent 
were interpolated to prevent any potential mispredictions. 
The system used kernel, spectral, and deep learning for 
the non-linear transformation and principal component 
analysis (PCA) for the linear transformation in order to 
reduce the total number of features. Subsequently, the 
Autoencoder method transformed the input data in the 
layer that was hidden into the latent space model using an 
unsupervised deep learning strategy. This method 
improved the system's ability to identify patterns and 
connections in the data coming in from the various 
sources. An equation for a hybrid deep learning strategy 
is as follows: 
Y = f(h(g(X)))                                            
[1] 
The input, represented by the symbol X, could be any 
type of data, including network traffic. Reducing the 
number of features used is the goal of a dimensionality 
reduction technique called g(X), where h(.) denotes the 
deep learning model's hidden layer and f(.) denotes the 
output layer. An anticipated botnet attack is represented 
by the model Y. 



A. LSTM Autoencoder 
For IoT network traffic analysis, a method that 
combines PCA for dimension reduction with an 
LSTM autoencoder for encoding large scale 
characteristics into a low dimension latent field is 
proposed. Because it allows for a deeper 
understanding of long-term time relationships, this 
feature effectively preserves significant information 
from the original data. From the various network 
data, the method seeks to find the lowest-dimensional  
subspace model for classification with the least degree of 
reconstruction error. The LSTM is a form of RNN that is 
used to handle sequential data, including data about 
network traffic. It may decide to remember or forget the 
previous components, which will result in long-term 
memory retention. x and the prior hidden state h are the 
inputs for the LSTM processes, and the output is the new 
hidden state h'. 
h' = LSTM(x, h)                                   
[2] 
Using a labeled dataset and backpropagation through time 
(BPTT), the weights and biases of the LSTM are trained. 
The generated model can detect botnet assaults by using 
network traffic information. 
Fig. 1. The system architecture  
B. Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet/CNN) 
The detection of botnets in network traffic data is a 
common use of CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks). 
The input data is processed through a sequence of 
convolutional layers of the CNN to extract hierarchical 
features. After that, an output layer with complete 
connectivity is used to classify the input data as either 
regular traffic or botnet attack. Stochastic gradient descent 
and back propagation are used to optimize CNN weights 
and biases on a labeled dataset.  
Y= f(W2 * ReLU(W1 * X + b1) + b2)  
A fully linked output layer and multiple convolutional 
layers make up a convolutional neural network (CNN). The 
input data in these designs is represented by the first 
convolutional layer's weight matrix (W1) and bias vector 
(b1), respectively. Similarly, W2 and b2 are the weight 
matrix and bias vector of the completely linked output 
layer. A softmax function, which is typically utilized for 
multi-class classification jobs, can be the output function 
f(.). 
To progressively lower the total amount of parameters and 
extract features from the data being input, CNNs are built 
using a hierarchical architecture resembling a funnel. The 
outcome is then processed by a linked layer.

C. Feature Dimensionality Reduction and Classification 
of Network Traffic 
In order to demonstrate the hybrid DL method's (PCA
CNN) effectiveness in identifying botnet attacks on 
Internet of Things networks, a quantitative evaluation is 
conducted. The Python programming language and 
associated libraries, such as Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, 
and Keras, were used to range this paper. Spyder is the 
name of the IDE that has been employed in research. 
1. Data Pre-Processing 
It was utilized to transform the elements of the 
multidimensional feature set. /[x(max)-x(min)]. Data Pre
Processing is the important stage that involves 
transforming the information into a structured format that 
is prepared for analysis. It entails purging unnecessary 
information from the dataset and structuring the data such 
that learning algorithms can make use of it. This method 
replaces missing values and NaN values with 0 and is 
used to encode categorical data. To ensure the dataset is 
accurate, mistakes, replication, and redundant data are 
eliminated as well.  Equation x(norm)=[x-x(min)] was 
used to explain the min-max transformation approach, 
which was utilized to transform the elements of the 
multidimensional feature set. /[x(max)-x(min)]. The 
values x(min) and x(max), respectively, represent the 
minimum and maximum values of the network traffic; 
The feature vector that characterizes the network flow is 
x. The traffic distribution feature is guaranteed by this 
method. The unprocessed feature collection of network 
capacity traffic that has been pre-processed is known as 
RAW-F. One way to simplify things is to use labels. In 
particular, labels 0 and 1 stood for the attack model and 
the original data labels, respectively. Different numerical 
values have been allocated to each class in the multi-class 
ground-truth labeling for various attack types, including 
DDoS, DoS, regular, espionage, and stealing.  One can 
depict stealing as number four, espionage as number 
three, and DDoS as number zero. Class labels are often 
expressed numerically in machine learning so that 
algorithms can handle categorical input. 
2. Data Normalization 
It is typically necessary to normalize the variables at the 
input level using common data normalization approaches 
in order to facilitate machine learning. The normalize 
function in the Python Pre-processing module is one way 
to rescale the input data to a 0-1 range. The function takes 
the array as input, modifies each input variable separately, 
and then outputs the array back. Standardization is an 
additional method of data scaling that entails figuring out 
the mean of each data point and deducting its standard 
deviation from that mean. In order to make the data more 
suited for some machine learning models, the method 
involves settling the data by adjusting the mean at zero 
and standardizing the data by producing a standard 
deviation of one.  
3. PCA for feature dimensionality reduction 
columns, or other input characteristics in a given dataset; 
dimensionality reduction is the process of removing these 
features. The process of reducing the size of a dataset 
without sacrificing the equivalent information is known as a 
"dimensionality reduction technique." In this stage, PCA 
(principal component analysis) is required. PCA is used for 
feature extraction, noise filtering, and visualization. By 
identifying significant connections in the data and making 
modifications to the current data based on these 
relationships, PCA is a dimensionality reduction approach. 
Next, we quantify the importance of these links so that we 
can cut the weaker ones and keep the most important ones. 
4. LSTM for network traffic classification 
The recurrent artificial neural network architecture known 
as LSTM (long short-term memory) has been embraced by 
the deep learning sector. Because LSTM has feedback 
connections, as opposed to traditional feedforward neural 
networks, it can assess entire data sequences as opposed to 
just individual data points. When it comes to classifying, 
processing, and forecasting time series data with potentially 
variable intervals between important events, LSTM is 
especially helpful.



D.  Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) 
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have emerged as 
fundamental tools for analyzing sequential data due to their 
inherent ability to retain temporal information. Within the 
realm of RNNs, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) 
and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks play 
pivotal roles. CNNs, originally developed for image 
processing, have been integrated into RNN architectures to 
extract spatial features from sequential data, enhancing 
performance in tasks like natural language processing and 
speech recognition. On the other hand, LSTM networks 
address the vanishing gradient problem in traditional RNNs 
by incorporating gated units, facilitating the modeling of 
long-range dependencies within sequential data. 
Methodologically, incorporating CNNs and LSTMs into 
RNN architectures requires careful consideration of 
network design, hyperparameter tuning, and training 
strategies. Researchers often experiment with various 
configurations and protocols to optimize performance for 
specific tasks, leveraging techniques like transfer learning 
and ensemble methods. The integration of CNNs and 
LSTMs within RNNs has led to significant advancements 
across diverse domains, including natural language 
processing, time series analysis, and biomedical research. 
Future research in this area holds promise for developing 
more sophisticated RNN architectures capable of tackling 
increasingly complex sequential data challenges. It is 
typically necessary to normalize the variables at the input 
level using common data normalization approaches in order 
to facilitate machine learning. The normalize function in the 
Python Pre-processing module is one way to rescale the 
input data to a 0-1 range. The function takes the array as 
input, modifies each input variable separately, and then 
outputs the array back. Standardization is an additional 
method of data scaling that entails figuring out the mean of 
each data point and deducting its standard deviation from

that mean. In order to make the data more suited for some 
machine learning models, the method involves settling the 
data by adjusting the mean at zero and standardizing the 
data by producing a standard deviation of one.

1. Data selection 
The process of identifying harmful network traffic is 
known as data selection. The dataset used for this purpose 
includes both regular Internet of Things (IoT) traffic and 
various instances of cyber-attacks, particularly those 
related to botnets. The study's input data was gathered 
from a dataset repository. 
Bot-IoT dataset has been employed as the source data for 
our system. The data selection method is used to identify 
malicious communications. Information about bot-net 
attacks, regular traffic patterns, the Internet of Things, and 
a plethora of other cyberattacks are all included in the 
collection.


3. Pre-processing 
It is typically necessary to normalize the parameters at the 
input level using common data normalization approaches 
in order to facilitate machine learning. The normalize 
function in the Python Pre-processing module is one way 
to rescale the input data to a 0-1 range. The function takes 
the array as input, modifies each input variable separately, 
and then outputs the array back. Standardization is an 
additional method of data scaling that entails figuring out 
the mean of each data point and deducting its standard 
deviation from that mean. In order to make the data more 
suited for some machine learning models, the method 
involves settling the data by adjusting the mean at zero 
and standardization of the data by producing a standard 
deviation of one.  
The process of Label Encoding step involves converting 
categorical data, such as different types of network 
activities or attack types, into numerical values. This helps 
the machine learning model understand and process the 
information more effectively, as it prefers numerical inputs. 
It's like giving each category a unique ID or number so the 
model can recognize and differentiate between them during 
training and prediction. 
4. Dimensionality reduction 
An approach known as "dimensionality reduction" can be 
used to reduce the number of dimensions in a       
higher-dimensional dataset while preserving the same 
amount of information. Principle component analysis, or 
PCA, is needed for this phase. 
5. Autoencoder 
An auto encoder is a specific type of neural network that 
can be used to learn a compressed representation of raw 
input. An auto encoder is composed of encoder and decoder 
sub-models. 
6. Classification 
Deep learning makes use of an artificial recurrent neural 
network architecture known as long short-term memory, or 
LSTM. The LSTM architecture has feedback connections, 
which sets it apart from conventional feedforward neural 
networks.



V. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Fig. 6. The correct detection rate of each algorithm during real-time traffic 
In the pursuit of understanding the effectiveness of various 
machine learning models for flow detection, the provided 
bar graph serves as a compelling visual aid. It encapsulates 
the performance of five distinct models - Recurrent Neural 
Networks (RNN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), 
Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP), Deep Neural Networks 
(DNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. 
4 
The graph is structured with the model types on the x-axis 
and their respective correct detection rates on the y-axis, 
which spans from 75% to 105%. Each model is 
represented by two bars, one green and one red, 
corresponding to the detection rates for normal and attack 
flows, respectively. 
A cursory glance at the graph reveals interesting insights. 
For instance, RNNs exhibit the highest detection rate for 
normal flows, while LSTM networks outperform the other 
models in detecting attack flows. On the other hand, 
CNNs and DNNs show relatively lower detection rates for 
normal and attack flows, respectively. This graphical 
representation underscores the nuanced performance 
differences between these models, offering valuable 
insights for discussions on model selection and 
optimization in the context of flow detection.  
It serves as a testament to the fact that the choice of model 
can significantly In earlier researches, we found that, on 
an average the detection rates of CNN and LSTM were 
higher than the other machine learning algorithms. We 
provide a technique to enhance botnet detection in 
Internet of Things networks, utilizing CNN and LSTM 
deep learning algorithms. We assess our framework's 
performance on the publicly accessible and continuously 
updated Bot-IoT Dataset, which encompasses a wide 
variety of network protocols, attack kinds, and attacks.  
Our experimental findings show that, on average, our 
suggested approach performs better than LSTM and is 
efficient.

normal and attack network traffic. The matrix is divided 
into four quadrants, each representing a different outcome 
of the classification process. The True Positive (TP)  
quadrant, colored green, represents instances where attack 
traffic was correctly identified. The True Negative (TN) 
quadrant, colored blue, denotes cases where normal traffic 
was accurately classified. On the other hand, the False 
Positive (FP) and False Negative (FN) quadrants, colored 
red and yellow respectively, represent instances of 
misclassification. FP refers to normal traffic incorrectly 
classified as an attack, while FN represents attack traffic 
that was misclassified as normal. This visual representation 
allows us to assess the accuracy and reliability of our 
model, providing valuable insights into its strengths and 
potential areas for improvement. It underscores the 
importance of precision in network traffic classification and 
highlights the challenges posed by false positives and 
negatives in maintaining network security. 
A. Accuracy 
The capacity of a predictor to accurately forecast class 
labels for fresh data is measured by its accuracy. It assesses 
how well a certain predictor can forecast an attribute's value 
for data that hasn't yet been seen. An essential component 
of evaluating the predictor's performance is how well it can 
make predictions. 
AC= (TP+TN)/ (TP+TN+FP+FN)       
B. Precision 
[4] 
Precision is a performance metric that is defined as the ratio 
of accurately determined positive cases to the total number 
of correctly as well as incorrectly identified positive 
instances. 
Precision=TP/ (TP+FP)                      
C. Recall 
[5] 
A binary classifier's accuracy in detecting affirmative cases 
is measured by a performance statistic called class recall.It 
is the percentage of all positive cases—including those 
mistakenly classified as negative—that were correctly 
recognized. In information retrieval, recall, also known as 
sensitivity, is the likelihood that a given search query will 
yield all relevant documents. 
Recall=TP/ (TP+FN)                      
[6] 
We also examine at our approach's memory needs, 
finding that it can store a lot of network traffic data with 
comparatively little memory usage. These requirements 
include reconstruction loss, feature data size, and 
dimensionality reduction rate. Furthermore, we evaluate 
our approach's overall classification and prediction 
performance using many measures, yielding a final 
performance assessment. We present a Confusion Matrix, 
a powerful tool for evaluating the performance of our 
classification model. This matrix, depicted in the 
accompanying image, provides a comprehensive 
overview of the model’s ability to distinguish between

The implementation of a sophisticated model combining 
Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Long Short-Term 
Memory (LSTM), and Convolutional Neural Networks 
(CNN) for the detection of Botnet attacks in Internet of 
Things (IoT) networks yielded promising outcomes. The 
model demonstrated exceptional performance with an 
overall accuracy of 96.516%. Moreover, it achieved a 
precision rate of 100%, emphasizing its ability to 
correctly classify instances of Botnet attacks without false 
positives. 
One of the crucial metrics, sensitivity, was recorded at 
96.516%, indicating the model's capability to accurately 
identify instances of Botnet attacks from the dataset. This 
high sensitivity suggests the model's effectiveness in 
detecting true positive cases while minimizing false 
negatives. 
Furthermore, the F1 score, a measure that considers both 
precision and sensitivity, was calculated at 98.227%. This 
robust F1 score underscores the model's overall 
effectiveness in achieving a balance between precision 
and recall, crucial for reliable Botnet attack detection. The 
dataset employed for training and evaluation, "Bot-IoT," 
provided a comprehensive representation of IoT network 
traffic, facilitating the model's learning process. After 
data splitting, the total number of instances used for 
training and testing amounted to 1062 and 456, 
respectively, resulting in a total of 1518 data points. 
In terms of model complexity, the total trainable 
parameters equaled the total parameters at 11542, 
indicating an efficient utilization of network resources 
without excessive overfitting. This balance between 
model complexity and performance highlights the 
robustness of the proposed approach for Botnet attack 
identification within IoT environments. Overall, the 
integration of PCA, LSTM, and CNN in our model 
showcases a promising avenue for enhancing the security 
of IoT networks against Botnet attacks. The achieved 
accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and F1 score validate the  
efficacy of the proposed methodology and its potential for 
real-world deployment in safeguarding IoT infrastructures 
from malicious threats. 
VI. CONCLUSION 
In this study, we introduced a unique method that 
leverages deep learning techniques like CNN and LSTM 
to detect botnet attacks in Internet of Things networks. 
We conducted extensive trials with the Bot-IoT dataset, 
which includes a variety of attack types and network 
protocols, in order to evaluate the effectiveness of our 
method. In both binary and multi-class classification 
scenarios, our suggested strategy beat LSTM on average, 
according to the evaluation findings. Because our dataset 
is updated, it serves as a relevant and trustworthy baseline 
for evaluating the efficacy of our methodology. Overall, 
our results point to the possibility of better botnet 
detection in IoT networks through the use of CNN and 
LSTM together. 
Our study marks a significant advancement in the realm of 
cybersecurity for Internet of Things (IoT) networks. By 
introducing a novel method that harnesses the power of 
deep learning techniques such as Convolutional Neural 
Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), 
we've made substantial strides in detecting and mitigating 
botnet attacks. 
Throughout our research, we conducted rigorous trials 
using the Bot-IoT dataset, which boasts a diverse range of 
attack types and network protocols. This comprehensive 
evaluation allowed us to thoroughly assess the efficacy of 
our proposed method across various scenarios. 
We found that, in both the multi-class and binary 
classification 
scenarios, 
our 
proposed 
technique 
consistently outperformed LSTM. This is a noteworthy 
finding from our evaluation. This superiority underscores 
the effectiveness of integrating CNN and LSTM, 
highlighting the complementary nature of these two deep 
learning architectures in enhancing botnet detection 
capabilities. Furthermore, the dynamic nature of the Bot
IoT dataset, regularly updated to reflect emerging threats 
and evolving network landscapes, serves as a pertinent and 
trustworthy benchmark for evaluating the effectiveness of 
our methodology. This ensures that our approach remains 
relevant and adaptable to the ever-changing cybersecurity 
landscape of IoT networks. 
In essence, our results not only demonstrate the potential 
for more robust botnet detection in IoT networks but also 
emphasize the significance of leveraging advanced deep 
learning techniques such as CNN and LSTM in tandem. By 
continuing to refine and innovate upon our methodology, 
we pave the way for heightened security and resilience in 
the face of evolving cyber threats targeting IoT ecosystems. 
VII. 
FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS 
Subsequent studies on unsupervised algorithms for IoT 
network botnet attack detection may be pursued. Given that 
unsupervised approaches do not require labelled data, they 
may be useful in situations where 
the dataset is minimal or the types of assaults are not well 
defined. Network traffic may be separated into numerous 
groups using clustering techniques like k-means and 
hierarchical clustering.  
These techniques can also be used to identify anomalous 
clusters that may indicate the presence of a botnet. It is also 
possible to find network traffic anomalies by employing 
techniques like Isolation Forest and one-class SVM. 
Creating a multi-layered model by combining various 
machine learning and deep learning techniques may also 
improve the detection performance. For example, a hybrid 
deep learning model with multiple layers that combines 
RNNs, CNNs, and autoencoders could be developed. 
Because the output of one layer may be the input for the 
next layer, the model can capture more intricate 
relationships in the network traffic data. Deep learning 
algorithms can be combined with other machine learning 
methods, such as support vector machines and decision 
trees, to improve overall performance. 



 7 Furthermore, the built-in model's performance might be 
evaluated on a larger and more diverse dataset in order to 
improve the model's generalizability. To see how well the 
model recognizes and blocks botnet attempts, it may also 
be tested on real-world IoT networks. It will also be 
important to address difficulties related to real-time 
processing, network scalability, and computational 
efficacy before deploying the model on a large-scale IoT 
network. Finally, techniques such as feature visualization 
and attribute analysis can be employed to enhance the 
comprehensibility of the generated model.  
 
This will improve our understanding of the model overall 
and enable us to pinpoint the components that are most 
crucial for identifying botnet attacks. Utilizing 
explainable AI techniques can also help the generated 
model's decision-making process gain credibility and 
transparency.
